This pulse of magnetic activity temporarily disrupts the normal activity in that area of the brain, which allows researchers to observe behavior when that area is not functioning.

**Transfer-appropriate processing theory** An explanation of positive transfer proposing that transfer is due to the similarity in the cognitive processing characteristics required by the two skills or two performance situations.

**Transfer of learning** The influence of prior learning on the learning of a new skill or the performance of a skill in a new context.

**Transfer test** A test in which a person performs a skill that is different from the skill that he or she practiced or performs the practiced skill in a context or situation different from the practice context or situation.

**Variable error (VE)** An error score representing the variability (or conversely, the consistency) of performance.

**Velocity** A kinematic measure describing the rate of change of an object’s position with respect to time. It is derived by dividing displacement by time (e.g., m/sec, km/hr).

**Verbal cues** Short, concise phrases that direct a performer’s attention to important environmental regulatory characteristics or that prompt the person to perform key movement pattern components of skills.

**Vigilance** Maintaining attention in a performance situation in which stimuli requiring a response occur infrequently.

**Visual field** The image or scene being viewed; it typically ­extends approximately 200 degrees horizontally and 160 degrees vertically.

**Visual search** The process of directing visual attention to ­locate relevant information in the environment that will enable a person to determine how to prepare and perform a skill in a ­specific situation.

**Visual selective attention** The process of engaging vision in directing attention to specific environmental information (i.e., cues) that influences the preparation and/or perfor­mance of an action. It is selective because the specific cues attended to must be chosen from among other possible cues in the performance environment. The selective attention process may be active or passive.

**Working memory** A functional system in the structure 
of memory that operates to temporarily store and use recently presented information; it also serves as a 
temporary workspace to integrate recently presented 
information with information retrieved from long-term memory to carry out problem-solving, decision-making, and action-preparation activities.
